    "to solve these two questions smoothly you should focus on the interpretation of the intercept and slope.\n",
    "\n",
    "intercept could be understood as the price of house with 0 feet^2 so it should be the same for zero meter^2 house.\n",
    "\n",
    "the slope could be considered -because it is positive- as the increase of price per 1 feet^2 so the slope should change and it is intuitive that it should be greater than the previous one because the meter is larger than the feet so the price will increase per one meter^2 more than per feet^2 and to get the new slope you should divide the given slope by 0.092903\n",

    "The question gives you an intercept parameter, b, which is in dollars, and a slope, which is in dollars/feet^2. It asks you to rescale the house-size dimension, using m^2 instead of foot^2. It tells you how many m^2 there are in a foot^2, let's call this C. The calculation we want involves how many feet^2 are in a m^2, which means we should divide the given slope by the number of m^2 in a foot^2. On the other hand, dollars don't change, so the intercept shouldn't be changed. So the over all formula I'm using is:\n",

    "One square foot = 0.09293 square meters. So, one square meeter is multiple square feet, right? 10.7607877 square feet, to be fairly precise. That is: 1 sq. meter / 0.09293 sq.meter per sq.ft = 10.7607877 sq.ft per sq.meter\n",
